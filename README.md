# PepeClicker
## Introduction
_Adapted from the included [report](https://github.com/PScoriae/PepeClicker/blob/master/pepeclicker_report.pdf)_.

Students of Object-oriented Programming PRG2104 in the April 2021 semester at Sunway University were tasked with a final project to demonstrate their **inheritance** and **polymorphism** programming knowledge. This was to be done in the Scala language with the use of the ScalaFX graphical user interface (GUI) library to create a GUI application.
Suggested standalone systems were:
- (Scientific) calculator
- Library Management System
- To-do list
- A personal game

The requirements of the system should have at least four use cases or functions. For example:
- Check In
- Check Out
- Search Book
- View Book

Of course, since this is an Object-oriented programming (OOP) class, students should also demonstrate OOP principles when implementing the system to achieve elegant design.

## PepeClicker
The proposed system for this project is based on the popular cookie clicker game but with styling in the form of the popular Internet meme “Pepe the Frog”. In a cookie clicker game, players simply click on a cookie on the screen and gain a cookie each time it is clicked. Accumulated cookies can then be used as currency to buy power-ups. Power-ups can change gameplay in various ways, but the classic power-ups typically increase the amount of cookies earned per click and grant cookies passively. Since the system takes styling from Pepe the Frog, various elements were changed to fit the meme and will later be discussed.
